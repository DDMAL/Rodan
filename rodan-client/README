To Run Rodan Client locally, you must have docker installed and have the docker images pulled from the nightly tag.
After installing docker, you can continue by replacing the docker-compose file with the one in the local-dev directory under the rodan-client directory. (dont forget to make the nginx container the same way as you do to run Rodan main for M1 systems)

After the installation, you have to `make run` and `docker-compose exec rodan-main /run/start` to have the rodan-main container run.

Next, you will need to CLI into the rodan client and make some manual changes to the config.json file. do `docker-compose exec rodan-client bash`.

Now, you are in the rodan-client container. Run `cd /code; yarn install`.

Move the COPYconfiguration file in the local-dev directory under rodan client to the rodan-client directory (These are all for the local development environment meaning that Rodan clone on your device and not the rodanclient container), to directory /code and name it `configuration.json`.

Replace /code/src/js/Configuration.js (this is in the container) content with the CPCONFIGFILE content under local-dev directory (local environment, not the container).

**NOTE**: If you cant replace the code using vim or your editor, you can copy the content, paste to the command line and use the command: `cat {paste the content} > {output_file}`

Continue by running the following commands in order
```
cd /code/node_modules/.bin
yarn global add gulp
gulp
```
Finally, go to localhost:8080, usr name and pwd are rodan.
