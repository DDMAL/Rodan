    // For an array of symbol names, this function would be O(n)
    // I think that we need to make a dict (a keyed array) out of symbol names.
    // so symbols['neume'] would be all the strings that start with neume
    // I could just do O(n) stuff all the time...
    // - sort the names alphabetically
    // - for i; i<count; ++i:  look for a string with name 'item'
    //   Actually: binary search would help
    // - when you find it, go 'index' more items down and return it if it's still a 'neume'
    // It would be so much nicer if I could key by symbol name... but what would be the
    // value?  An array of all the neumes?  That's not possible for a normal dict.
    // I think that I could one-shot build a tree thing out of lists
    // - the leaves could be glyphs
    // - that could help with the 'selection' problem.  If a leaf is selected, I'll have
    // the glyph object and can tell the other view what to select.
    // If a node is selected, then select all of the leaves of it.
    // What about using regexes to match... like ^clef or ^clef.c etc.
    // That would be fast, if the symbols were like lines in a file and if I could use grep.
    // I think I need to find a tree data structure... a multi linked list
    // I could do tree.add(glyph) and it would get put into the proper spot.
    // The link names would be symbol names, like root.child... ?
    // What about XML?
    // We could get up to 18000 glyphs... does it have to be super efficient?
    // Each list would be a dict.  Each node can have glyph leaves.

    // If I could just do it in python: have one giant string with newlines between
    // the symbol names and use re.search to give back the arrays...
    // I can see why Gamera doesn't let you select a node in the tree and
    // have it match with the collection view.
    // theClassifier has an array of Glyphs, which aren't even keyed by symbol name.

    // I don't think we need a tree.  If it's flat, you still get all the info out
    // from the naming.  You sort alphebetically and the tree is obvious.
    // How about just make it a list on the left??  You can then get the Glyphs
    // out in O(n) just by comparing names.  You lose the 'hide' functionality of
    // the outline view, but I don't think that's a big loss... you can use the scroll
    // bar.

    // Note: display each symbol name once, and consider a (count) in brackets.
    // I'll sleep on it.

    // If I do want an outline view, dictionaries could do the trick
    //{
    //    'neume': {'virga': {}
    //    }
    //}

    // One main problem with the list idea is that the '.' loses it's meaning:
    // it's just strings then that follow a pattern.  The dots are meaningful
    // to Gamera and we need to convey that.

    // What if I omit text, to convey meaning, in a way that doesn't waste rows...
    // (You will only be able to drag and drop into bins that already have a neume.)
