# Heuristic Pitch Finding
Heuristic staff and pitch finding for square as a job in the workflow builder [```Rodan```](https://github.com/DDMAL/Rodan)

## Prereq

Heuristic Pitch Finding is deployed as a Rodan [Job Package](https://github.com/DDMAL/Rodan/wiki/Write-a-Rodan-job-package). Before installing, ensure that the latestest version of [`rodan-docker`](https://github.com/DDMAL/rodan-docker) has been cloned locally, built, and installed.

## Installing into rodan-docker
1. Clone this directory into `/path/to/rodan_docker/jobs/heuristic-pitch-finding`
2. In `/path/to/rodan_docker/docker-compose.job-dev.yml`, add the reference to volumes like so:
``` python
    volumes:
     - ./jobs/settings.py:/code/rodan/rodan/settings.py
     - ./jobs/heuristic-pitch-finding/:/code/rodan/rodan/jobs/heuristic-pitch-finding
```
3. If one does not already exist, create a python file called `settings.py` in the rodan jobs folder like so: `/path/to/rodan_docker/jobs/settings.py`
4. Copy and paste the contents of `settings.py.job_development` into `settings.py`
5. Add this package path to the Rodan Job Package registration in the `settings.py` file. This should look something like the following
``` python
RODAN_JOB_PACKAGES = (
  "rodan.jobs.job1",
  "rodan.jobs.job2",
  ...,
  "rodan.jobs.heuristic-pitch-finding",
)
```

## Running Rodan
- Follow the [rodan-docker guide](https://github.com/DDMAL/rodan-docker/blob/master/README.md) to have docker set up.
- Once the above installation steps are complete, run ```docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rodan-dev.yml up``` 

## Job Usage
- To properly setup the pitch finding workflow, connect the *JSOMR* output from a `Miyao Staff Finding` job to the *JSOMR* input of a `Heuristic Pitch Finding` job. 

*Important Note:*
- Staff finding can be run independently if only the staff positions, line points, and general page properties are required. However, pitch finding always requires the output of staff finding as an input.
