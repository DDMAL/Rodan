- move scripts currently in ./rodan/scripts into centralized location (say, ./building_helper_scripts)
- rename the "rodan" docker container to "rodan-container" or something so there aren't three "Rodan"s in the file path
- remove all those huge images from calvo classifier to dramatically reduce image sizes
- clean up makefile to remove / change unneeded commands (i.e. get rid of all the git clones)
- figure out what to do about vis-rodan
- get rid of nightly builds via the cronjob on staging or prod (where is it?) no longer necessary since builds trigger on pull requests
- look at gamera 4 to see if it'll work? mess around with it in a venv?
