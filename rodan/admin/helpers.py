## BEGIN - include url patterns with view decorator

def required(wrapping_functions,patterns_rslt):

    Used to require 1..n decorators in any view returned by a url tree

    Usage:
      urlpatterns = required(func,patterns(...))
      urlpatterns = required((func,func,func),patterns(...))

    Note:
      Use functools.partial to pass keyword params to the required
      decorators. If you need to pass args you will have to write a
      wrapper function.

    Example:
      from functools import partial

      urlpatterns = required(
          partial(login_required,login_url='/accounts/login/'),
          patterns(...)
      )

        if not hasattr(rslt,'func'):return rslt
        f = getattr(rslt,'func')

        for _f in reversed(wrapping_functions):
            # @decorate the function from inner to outter
            f = _f(f)

        setattr(rslt,'func',f)

        return rslt

def logged_in_or_basicauth(realm = ""):
    """
    A simple decorator that requires a user to be logged in. If they are not
    logged in the request is examined for a 'authorization' header.

    If the header is present it is tested for basic authentication and
    the user is logged in with the provided credentials.

    If the header is not present a http 401 is sent back to the
    requestor to provide credentials.

    The purpose of this is that in several django projects I have needed
    several specific views that need to support basic authentication, yet the
    web site as a whole used django's provided authentication.

    The uses for this are for urls that are access programmatically such as
    by rss feed readers, yet the view requires a user to be logged in. Many rss
    readers support supplying the authentication credentials via http basic
    auth (and they do NOT support a redirect to a form where they post a
    username/password.)

    Use is simple:

    @logged_in_or_basicauth
    def your_view:
        ...

    You can provide the name of the realm to ask for authentication within.
