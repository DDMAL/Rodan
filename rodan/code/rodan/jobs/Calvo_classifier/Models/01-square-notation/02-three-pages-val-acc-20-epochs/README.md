### Model information

These models were created using three concatenated pages of the Salzinnes 
Antiphonal manuscript. As a reference length, the average staffline interspace 
in this manuscript is 62 pixels.

Images provided are examples of inference with a page not used during training.




Max number of epochs: 20
Early stopping metric: val_accuracy

Training time (single P100 GPU): 01:40:47
Inference time per page (single VP-100 GPU): 00:04:54
